## Python 2.7 Quick Reference

This is the [reference guide to Python](reference.py) that I wish had existed when I was learning the language.

Here's what I want in a reference guide:

- High-quality examples that show the simplest possible usage of a given feature
- Explanatory comments, and descriptive variable names that eliminate the need for some comments
- Presented as a single Python script, so that I can keep it open in my IDE and search it when needed
- Code that can be run from top to bottom, with the relevant objects defined nearby

This is not written as a full-fledged Python tutorial, though I ordered the topics such that you can read it like a tutorial (each topic depends only on material preceding it).

### Topics

- [Imports](reference.py#L28)
- [Data Types](reference.py#L52)
- [Math](reference.py#L84)
- [Comparisons and Boolean Operations](reference.py#L102)
- [Conditional Statements](reference.py#L118)
- [Lists](reference.py#L147)
- [Tuples](reference.py#223)
- [Strings](reference.py#L258)
- [Dictionaries](reference.py#L319)
- [Sets](reference.py#L371)
- [Defining Functions](reference.py#L408)
- [Anonymous (Lambda) Functions](reference.py#L473)
- [For Loops and While Loops](reference.py#L494)
- [Comprehensions](reference.py#L540)
- [Map, Reduce, Filter](reference.py#L594)

### Other Resources

If you like the general format of this guide, but need more explanation of each topic, I highly recommend reading the Appendix of [Python for Data Analysis](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920023784.do). It presents the essentials of the Python language in a clear and focused manner.

If you are looking for a resource that will help you to learn Python from scratch, this is [my list of recommended resources](https://github.com/justmarkham/DAT8#python-resources).

### Getting in Touch

If there's a topic or example you'd like me to add to this guide, or you notice a mistake, please [create a GitHub issue](../../issues) or [contact me directly](http://www.dataschool.io/about/).

Thank you!
